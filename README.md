<h1>InstantID: Zero-shot Identity-Preserving Generation in Seconds</h1>



## Download
For face encoder, you need to manually download via this [URL](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/issues/1896#issuecomment-1023867304) to `models/antelopev2` as the default link is invalid.
Make sure the antelopev2.zip is unizipped to antelopev2 dir under model dir. For my demo I have mounted google drive and unzipped antelopev2 under /content/drive/MyDrive/models. You can choose own directory structure if you want.


## Start a gradio demo
Run the following command:
In my case the antelopev2 dir is under /content/drive/MyDrive/models
Run the command once we have proper directory structure
```python
python gradio_demo/app.py --face_analysis_root /content/drive/MyDrive/ 
```

## Usage Tips
- For higher similarity, increase the weight of controlnet_conditioning_scale (IdentityNet) and ip_adapter_scale (Adapter).
- For over-saturation, decrease the ip_adapter_scale. If not work, decrease controlnet_conditioning_scale.
- For higher text control ability, decrease ip_adapter_scale.
- For specific styles, choose corresponding base model makes differences.
- We have not supported multi-person yet, will only use the largest face as reference pose.
- We provide a [style template](https://github.com/ahgsql/StyleSelectorXL/blob/main/sdxl_styles.json) for reference.
