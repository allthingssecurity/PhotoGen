<h1>InstantID: Zero-shot Identity-Preserving Generation in Seconds</h1>

## Download

You can directly download the model from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/InstantX/InstantID).
You also can download the model in python script:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
hf_hub_download(repo_id="InstantX/InstantID", filename="ControlNetModel/config.json", local_dir="./checkpoints")
hf_hub_download(repo_id="InstantX/InstantID", filename="ControlNetModel/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors", local_dir="./checkpoints")
hf_hub_download(repo_id="InstantX/InstantID", filename="ip-adapter.bin", local_dir="./checkpoints")
```

If you cannot access to Huggingface, you can use [hf-mirror](https://hf-mirror.com/) to download models.
```python
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
huggingface-cli download --resume-download InstantX/InstantID --local-dir checkpoints
```

For face encoder, you need to manually download via this [URL](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/issues/1896#issuecomment-1023867304) to `models/antelopev2` as the default link is invalid. Once you have prepared all models, the folder tree should be like:
Make sure the antelopev2.zip is unizipped to antelopev2 dir under model dir.
```

  â””â”€â”€ README.md
```





## Start a gradio demo
Run the following command:
In my case the antelopev2 dir is under /content/drive/MyDrive/models
Run the command once we have proper directory structure
```python
python gradio_demo/app.py --face_analysis_root /content/drive/MyDrive/ 
```

## Usage Tips
- For higher similarity, increase the weight of controlnet_conditioning_scale (IdentityNet) and ip_adapter_scale (Adapter).
- For over-saturation, decrease the ip_adapter_scale. If not work, decrease controlnet_conditioning_scale.
- For higher text control ability, decrease ip_adapter_scale.
- For specific styles, choose corresponding base model makes differences.
- We have not supported multi-person yet, will only use the largest face as reference pose.
- We provide a [style template](https://github.com/ahgsql/StyleSelectorXL/blob/main/sdxl_styles.json) for reference.
